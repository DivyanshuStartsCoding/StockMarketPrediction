Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

Project Overview

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock market prices. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is well-suited for time series analysis due to its ability to learn and remember long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Results

The model achieves good accuracy for stock price trends over short time frames. Visualizations help highlight prediction trends.

Future Improvements

	•	Integrate additional features like sentiment analysis from news.
	•	Experiment with hybrid models combining LSTM with attention mechanisms.
	•	Enhance scalability for larger datasets.
